Go library for Garmin Virb Cameras

This implements the [network
API](https://developer.garmin.com/downloads/virb/Camera_Network_Services_API_v0.5.pdf)
exposed by Garmin's Virb cameras with WiFi.  It has been tested with the Virb
Ultra 30 and Virb 360, but should work with the Virb X, XE, and several of
Garmin's Dashcam models as well.

It also includes a `virb` command-line tool that is mostly useful for testing
the library, although it can be used to start and stop recording on command.


This is not an official Google project.
